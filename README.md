cf-sketch-debs
==============

Ubuntu Debian packages for cf-sketch for supported LTS versions (lucid 10.04 and precise 12.04) x64
I am polling the design-center daily around 3am for changes, and building new packages on changes.

If you would like this in a usable repository for apt install, please let me know via email jon@jonzobrist.com.
I am only pushing here as a side effect of building packages for me to use.
